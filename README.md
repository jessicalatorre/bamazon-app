<h2>The Bamazon Shoping App</h2>

<p>This app allow customers to place orders for retail camping items directly in the command line. Node is used as the run-time environment, so the JavaScript logic can be run server-side. The MySQL database management system is also used, so once a customer finishes a purchase, the inventory is correctly reduced. </p>

<h3>Node Module</h3>

<p> The Inquirer npm package enables customers to be prompted for their desired purchase once Node is running. The My-SQL module allows for querying the Bamazon database via JavaScript based on the product ID\(s\) and the quantities customers type when making purchases. Lastly, the Colors npm package is also used to give customers a more visually appealing experience.</p>

<p>Here's a brief video demonstration of how the app works: https://drive.google.com/drive/my-drive</p>

<p>Feel free to look at at my bamazonCustomer.js to take a closer look at the JavaScript code: https://github.com/jessicalatorre/bamazon-app/blob/master/bamazonCustomer.js</p>
